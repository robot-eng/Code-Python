# Numpy

## **Intro to numpy**

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computations in scientific and engineering applications. NumPy stands for "Numerical Python". It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy is designed to be efficient and optimized for numerical computations. It is written in C and allows users to perform operations on arrays that are much faster than if they were performed in pure Python. NumPy also integrates well with other scientific computing libraries, such as SciPy and Matplotlib.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use NumPy in a Python program, you first need to import the library using the import numpy statement. Once imported, you can create NumPy arrays using the numpy.array() function or other NumPy functions like numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones(), and numpy.random.rand().</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists, but they can have any number of dimensions and are more efficient for numerical computations. NumPy arrays can also be sliced and indexed like Python lists and can be used in mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy is a fundamental library for data science and machine learning, and it is used extensively in the scientific and engineering communities for numerical computations.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy arrays are represented in memory as a contiguous block of data, with the dimensions of the array specified by a tuple of integers. Each element in the array is stored in a fixed-size block of memory, allowing for fast access and manipulation of the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy provides a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions that operate on NumPy arrays. These functions are implemented in C for performance, and they can be used to perform complex mathematical operations on large datasets efficiently. NumPy also supports broadcasting, which allows arrays of different shapes to be operated on element-wise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy arrays can be created using various functions provided by the library, such as `numpy.array()`, `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`, and `numpy.random.rand()`. Once created, NumPy arrays can be sliced and indexed like Python lists, and they can be used in mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NumPy also integrates well with other scientific computing libraries, such as SciPy and Matplotlib. These libraries build on top of NumPy to provide additional functionality for scientific computing and data analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, NumPy provides a powerful array object and a vast collection of mathematical functions that are optimized for performance. This makes it a popular choice for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications.

## **Usage numpy.zeros()**

`numpy.zeros()` is a NumPy function that creates an array filled with zeros of the specified shape and data type. The function takes a shape tuple as input, which specifies the dimensions of the array, and an optional `dtype` parameter, which specifies the data type of the array. Here's the syntax of the function:
```python
numpy.zeros(shape, dtype=float, order='C')
```

```
[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]]

There are several benefits of using `numpy.zeros()` to create arrays filled with zeros:

1. Convenience: `numpy.zeros()` provides a convenient way to create an array filled with zeros of a specified shape and data type. This can be useful in situations where you need to create an array quickly and easily.

2. Speed: `numpy.zeros()` is implemented in C, which makes it much faster than creating an array filled with zeros using a Python loop. This makes it a good choice for situations where performance is important, such as when working with large datasets or performing complex computations.

3. Memory efficiency: `numpy.zeros()` creates an array with all elements initialized to zero, which can be more memory efficient than creating an array filled with a default value. This is because zero takes up less memory than other values, such as `None` or `False`.

4. Compatibility: `numpy.zeros()` creates an array that is compatible with other NumPy functions and operations, which makes it easy to integrate into larger programs and workflows.

Overall, `numpy.zeros()` is a powerful function that provides a convenient and efficient way to create arrays filled with zeros. Its speed, memory efficiency, and compatibility with other NumPy functions make it a popular choice for scientific computing and data analysis tasks.

## **Usage numpy.full()**
`numpy.full()` is a NumPy function that creates a new array of the specified shape and type, filled with a specified value. The function takes three arguments: `shape`, `fill_value`, and `dtype`.

Here's the syntax of the function:
```Python
numpy.full(shape, fill_value, dtype=None, order='C', *, like=None)
```
The `shape` parameter is a tuple that specifies the dimensions of the array, `fill_value` is the value that will fill the array, and `dtype` is the data type of the array. If `dtype` is not provided, NumPy will choose a data type based on the value of `fill_value`.

Here's an example of how to use `numpy.full()` to create a 2D array filled with a specified value:
```Python
import numpy as np

# create a 2D array of size 3x4 filled with the value 5
arr = np.full((3, 4), 5)

print(arr)
```
Output:
```
[[5 5 5 5]
 [5 5 5 5]
 [5 5 5 5]]
```
In this example, we use `np.full()` to create a 2D array of `size (3, 4)` filled with the value `5`. The resulting array is of type `int64`, which is the default data type for `numpy.full()`.

#### **What is numpy.full() used for?**
`numpy.full()` is a NumPy function that is commonly used to create an array filled with a specified value of a specified shape and data type. Here are some common use cases for `numpy.full()`:

3. Comparison operations: `numpy.full()` can be used to create an array with a specified shape and value, which can then be used to compare against other arrays of the same shape. This is often used in unit testing to check that the output of a function matches the expected output.

4. Data manipulation: `numpy.full()` can be used to create an array of a specified shape and value, which can then be used to perform mathematical operations, such as scaling or normalization, on other arrays of the same shape.

Overall, `numpy.full()` is a versatile function that is used in a variety of applications to create arrays filled with a specified value. The function allows for the creation of arrays with a specified shape and data type, which makes it a powerful tool for scientific computing and data analysis tasks.

#### **Benefits of numpy.full()**
Here are some of the benefits of using numpy.full() to create arrays:

1. Flexibility: `numpy.full()` allows you to create arrays of any shape and any data type, and fill them with any specified value. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you create and manipulate arrays for your specific use case.

2. Performance: Similar to other NumPy functions, `numpy.full()` is optimized for performance, and is implemented in C under the hood. This means that it is much faster than using Python loops to create arrays of a specific shape and value.

3. Memory efficiency: By filling an array with a specified value at initialization, you can create an array that is more memory-efficient than if you were to initialize it with random values or leave it empty. This can be especially important when dealing with large datasets.

4. Consistency: By creating an array with a specific shape and value, you can ensure that your data is consistent across all elements of the array. This can help avoid errors and inconsistencies in your data, and make it easier to perform computations and analysis.
